"""
Lesson: Data Types, Variables, and Why Loops Are Necessary
----------------------------------------------------------
This file is intentionally incomplete.
Your job is to experiment, fill in blanks, and notice patterns.
"""

# --- Section 1: Variables and Data Types ---

# TODO: Create a variable called name that stores your name
# TODO: Create a variable called age that stores your age
# TODO: Create a variable called pi that stores the value 3.14159

# Print each variable
print("Name:", )
print("Age:", )
print("Pi:", )


# --- Section 2: Why Loops? ---

# Imagine you want to print the numbers 1 through 10.
# First, try it the "long way".

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)

# TODO: Keep going until you reach 10

# Question for you:
#   What happens if I want to print 1 through 100? Or 1 through 1000?
#   Is it realistic to keep writing print statements forever?


# --- Section 3: For Loops ---
# TODO: Replace the repeated print statements above with a for loop.

# Example starter (fill in the blanks):
# for ___ in ___:
#     print(___)

# Hint: What does range(start, stop) do?


# --- Section 4: While Loops ---
# A while loop repeats until a CONDITION is no longer true.

# TODO: Try to print numbers 1 through 10 using a while loop.

# Example starter:
# x = 1
# while ___:
#     print(___)
#     # TODO: Donâ€™t forget to change x, or your loop will run forever!
x=1
while x<=10:
    print("less than 0")
    x=x+1

# --- Section 5: Reflection ---
# Answer these questions (in comments):
# 1. Why is a loop better than writing 100 print statements?
# 2. What does a loop REQUIRE in order to work?
#    (Think: starting point, stopping condition, something that changes)
